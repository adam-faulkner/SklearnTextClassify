# SklearnTextClassify


This project implements basic text classification functionality using Sklearn. It will be of interest to anyone who'd like to  quickly run text classification experiments with a minimum of fuss and wrangling with the Sklearn API. Sklearn tends to make common feature generation functionality such as concatenation of different feature types (e.g., categorical and numeric types) an oddly difficult process. Several Stackoverflow exchanges testify to this.  Here, I've collected various solutions to creating heterogenous feature types in Sklearn along with more contemporary types such as embeddings-based features.
