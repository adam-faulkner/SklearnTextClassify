not long fully engaged characters , entertained many zingers delivered back forth allen hunt , actually interested resolution flick also appreciated allen played fine line homage films old , parody actual reinvention \( note theron 's entire female persona drenched film noir cool \) course , films like \( little no real tension plot \) need solid actors keep interested quick fire dialogue , , allen does great job playing character , , n't typical new york jewish neurotic cheating insecure husband dude actually plays macho guy handles pretty well , especially scenes 's hypnotized bigger surprise film helen hunt , actress openly sick seeing movies late last year \( sorry babe , just many time ! \) anyway , 's really great film headstrong woman looking new era equality amongst men , does n't miss beat allen 's fast paced dialogue n't care much running joke dying whenever left room , overall really good especially liked way sweaters clung breasts yum , yum ! harumph , digress let 's recap great looking picture nice jazzy score , funny one liners , especially second half , decent plotline , although should n't expect real mystery anything , solid acting around ca n't say even remotely close allen 's best work , certainly believe step right direction , especially dinky decade films just went 's probably better geared towards allen fans anyone else , would still recommend film anyone looking cute , old school kind vibe , chemistry leads , zippy dialogue satisfying conclusion little known facts film stars annie hall \( 10 10 \) celebrity \( 5 10 \) everyone says love \(
